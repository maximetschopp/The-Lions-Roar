                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We are a student-run weekly news broadcast show that aims to cover current events and issues relevant to Zurich International School. Our team is entirely composed of students from grades six to twelve, with two teacher advisors who act as producers. We design, direct, write, create, and publish our weekly videos on our own–championing the process from pre-production to post. Additionally, we write articles, maintain this website, and market our show to a wide audience of students, faculty and staff, and families. Our mission is to both streamline announcements, cover major events, and report on newsworthy information. We are proud members of our community and want to always share stories with a Lion’s Roar. </p>
